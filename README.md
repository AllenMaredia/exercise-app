# Exercise App

Using ReactJS, Javascript, and HTML/CSS I was able to create a fitness exercise app that allows you to search for any exercise based on target muscle group and gives detailed descriptions about the exercise along with youtube video recommendations and similar exercises that target the same muscle group and exercises that use the same equipment.
